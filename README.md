# EasyMounter

A GUI program for mounting Windows ([CIFS](https://www.samba.org/cifs/)) shares on BeOS. Actually, a graphical front-end for the command-line program `cifsmount`.

**Note:** If you have WON or samba working, you don't need this program.

As BeOS has become [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/), this project is provided for historical reasons.
